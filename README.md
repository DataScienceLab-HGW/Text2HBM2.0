# Text2HBM2.0
A tool for the automatic generation of domain models from textual sources.

To run the tool you will need the packages listed in conda_env_packages.txt and also:
- wordnet, in particular WordNet Release 3.0 (imported from nltk.corpus) 
- the stanford parser (we tested our tool with Stanford Lexicalized Parser v3.9.1 - 2018-02-27) which needs to be put into the directory stanford-parser-full-2018-02-27
